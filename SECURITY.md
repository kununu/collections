# Security Policy

## For external contributors

If you want to report any security vulnerabilities please do so by creating an [issue](https://github.com/kununu/collections/issues).
Additionally, if you have a fix then please create a pull request and link it to the issue you have created.

## For kununu developers

### Reporting a Vulnerability

JIRA is our entrypoint to report security vulnerabilities. Having this in mind a `KUNSECU` user story (type Vulnerability) needs to be created.

#### How to fill the user story?

Follow this [documentation](https://kununu-team.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kununu/pages/22889606/Vulnerability+Issue+Type+Jira).

#### To which team do I assign the user story?

Follow the [domain ownership matrix](https://kununu-team.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kununu/pages/22972065/Domain+ownership+matrix) and assign it to the corresponding team.

## Reporting the update of dependencies

This is the benefit of having Dependabot. It will open pull requests for security and version updates. For more information check the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates).
